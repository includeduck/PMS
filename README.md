## 🌟 Overview

The **Publications Management System (PMS)** empowers university students, researchers, department heads, and administrative staff to easily discover and share scholarly works. 

Whether an external visitor browsing open-access research, a student accessing papers from campus, or a researcher publishing new findings, PMS provides an intuitive and responsive experience backed by automated metadata extraction and robust role-based access control.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- 🔍 **Faceted Academic Search**: Search publications by free-text keywords, specific author names, and publication date intervals with clear pagination.
- ⚡ **Smart Metadata Extraction**: Upload PDF papers, BibTeX (`.bib`), or RIS (`.ris`) citations to instantly extract titles, authors, journals, DOIs, and abstracts.
- 📦 **Bulk & Single Downloads**: Download individual research papers or bundle entire query results into organized ZIP archives with one click.
- 🌐 **VUB Campus Network Mode**: Simulates on-campus IP-authenticated access for quick research discovery without manual credentials.
- 🏢 **Departmental Organization**: Manage academic department groups with dynamic live membership validation.
- 🔒 **6-Tier Role Security**: Enforces granular permissions ranging from public guests to department moderators and global administrators.

## 👥 User Roles & Permissions

PMS organizes privileges into a 6-level role hierarchy. Higher roles inherit the capabilities of the roles below them:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A["Administrator (Level 6)"] --> B["Moderator (Level 5)"]
    B --> C["Publisher (Level 4)"]
    C --> D["Member (Level 3)"]
    D --> E["VUB Network User (Level 2)"]
    E --> F["Guest (Level 1)"]
    
    style A fill:#e0f2fe,stroke:#0284c7,stroke-width:2px;
    style B fill:#e0e7ff,stroke:#4338ca,stroke-width:2px;
    style C fill:#fef3c7,stroke:#d97706,stroke-width:2px;
    style D fill:#dcfce7,stroke:#16a34a,stroke-width:2px;
    style E fill:#f3e8ff,stroke:#9333ea,stroke-width:2px;
    style F fill:#f1f5f9,stroke:#64748b,stroke-width:2px;
```

| Role | Hierarchy Level | What Can They Do? |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **Guest** | `1` | Browse and search publications; view abstract and citation information. |
| **VUB-Network User** | `2` | All Guest privileges + download publication full-text files and bulk ZIP bundles. |
| **Member** | `3` | All VUB-Network privileges + personal account profile and session authentication. |
| **Publisher** | `4` | All Member privileges + upload new papers (with PDF/BibTeX/RIS extraction) and edit owned publications. *(Cannot delete papers)*. |
| **Moderator** | `5` | All Publisher privileges + department-scoped user management (create, view, edit users in their assigned department). |
| **Administrator** | `6` | Full system control: global user management across all departments, department group creation/deletion, and system maintenance. |

## 🏛️ System Architecture

PMS is built with a clean, decoupled **Model-View-Template-Service (MVTS)** pattern:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Presentation ["Presentation Layer"]
        UI["Bootstrap 5 Templates"]
        Nav["Context-Aware Navigation"]
    end

    subgraph Security ["Access Control Layer"]
        Perm["require_role Decorator"]
        Roles["Role Hierarchy Engine"]
    end

    subgraph Logic ["Service Layer"]
        SearchSvc["Search & Filtering Engine"]
        MetaSvc["Metadata Extractor (PDF/BibTeX/RIS)"]
        ZipSvc["ZIP Archive Bundler"]
        AuthSvc["Token & Activation Service"]
    end

    subgraph Persistence ["Data Layer"]
        UserModel["Custom User & Profiles"]
        PubModel["Publication & File Storage"]
        DeptModel["Department Groups"]
    end

    UI --> Perm --> Roles
    Perm --> Logic
    Logic --> Persistence
```

## 🧪 Running Tests & Quality Assurance

PMS includes a comprehensive, automated test suite covering all services, views, permission gates, and edge cases.

To run the complete test suite with verbose output:
```bash
pytest -v
```

### Test Suite Breakdown:
- **`accounts/tests.py`**: Role inheritance, user registration, 24h confirmation tokens, Moderator vs Admin scoping, login/logout, and network mode toggling.
- **`orgs/tests.py`**: Department group creation, live non-empty deletion prevention, and admin authorization.
- **`publications/tests.py`**: Keyword/author/date search, download permissions, automated PDF/BibTeX/RIS extraction, bulk ZIP bundling, and publisher editing ownership.
- **Status**: **45 passing unit & integration tests** (100% pass rate).

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline

Continuous Integration is automated using **GitHub Actions** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`). Every push and pull request triggers a multi-stage validation workflow:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Push / Pull Request] --> B[Matrix Build: Python 3.11 & 3.12]
    B --> C[Install Dependencies & pypdf]
    C --> D[Django System Check: manage.py check]
    D --> E[Migration Check: makemigrations --check --dry-run]
    E --> F[Automated Test Suite: pytest -v]
    F --> G([Build Passed])
```

- **Multi-Version Matrix**: Ensures compatibility across Python 3.11 and 3.12.
- **Integrity Validation**: Verifies that no unstaged migrations exist (`--check --dry-run`).
- **Automated Testing**: Executes the full 45-test suite before any code merges into `main`.

## 🛡️ Security & Business Rules

1. **Email Confirmation Expiration**: Registration activation tokens expire strictly after 24 hours. Expired or reused tokens are rejected.
2. **Safe Department Deletion**: A department cannot be deleted if any users are assigned to it (`group.members.exists()`).
3. **Department-Scoped Moderation**: Moderators can only view and manage users within their own department. They cannot escalate privileges or modify users in other departments.
4. **Publisher Edit Ownership**: Publishers can only edit publications they authored or uploaded. Deletion of publications is reserved for administrative review.
5. **Network Access Verification**: Full-text publication files and bulk archives are shielded from unauthenticated public guests, accessible only via registered accounts or campus network mode.
